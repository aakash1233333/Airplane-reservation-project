Airplane Reservation Project
This is an airplane reservation project built using C++. The program allows users to make reservations for a flight by selecting their departure and destination cities, and their preferred travel dates. Users can also choose their preferred seat type and meal option.
The program uses a text file to store flight data, including the flight number, departure and destination cities, travel dates, seat availability, and meal options. The program reads and updates the text file based on the user's reservation requests.
